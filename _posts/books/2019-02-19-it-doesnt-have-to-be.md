People can't get work done at work anymore. That turns life into work's leftovers.

What's worse is that long hours, excessive busyness, and lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for many people these days. **Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it's a mark of stupidity.**


The answer isn't more hours, it's less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. and far fewer distractions, less always-on anxiety, and avoiding stress.
